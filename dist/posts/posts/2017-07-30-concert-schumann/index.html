Since around two years (although I don’t think anyone knows when exactly it begun, because we started as a group of friends just fancy playing music together in our spare time) I’m a member of salsa band named ‘La Suerte Band’. One might ask 'why salsa?’ but it’s another story that started with me doing salsa dancing classes in a dance school that also happened to be a community of amazing people (crazy about salsa).

Later applied also to music in connection to the use of 'colour in music'- timbre. Elements often termed 'impressionistic' include static harmony, focusing on suggestion and atmosphere, use of modes and exotic scales, extra-musicality, avoidance of traditional musical form and focusing on timbre as a first-tier component of the musical performance. "],"t":"p"},"\n",{"c":["Personally, impressionism is one of my favourite periods in arts. There is some elusiveness in that style that makes the music sound intimate and mysterious. When performing an impressionistic piece sometimes it's not even about playing the right sounds that were written by a composer, but about creating a special atmosphere. And there is always a story to tell, behind the musical scores.
