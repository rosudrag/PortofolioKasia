Since around two years (although I don’t think anyone knows when exactly it begun, because we started as a group of friends just fancy playing music together in our spare time) I’m a member of salsa band named ‘La Suerte Band’. One might ask 'why salsa?’ but it’s another story that started with me doing salsa dancing classes in a dance school that also happened to be a community of amazing people (crazy about salsa). Since then I totally soaked in it and now playing with these guys is as natural and obvious thing for me as eating cereal in the morning. "],"t":"p"},"\n",{"t":"p"},"\n",{"c":["Below some videos from our performances.
