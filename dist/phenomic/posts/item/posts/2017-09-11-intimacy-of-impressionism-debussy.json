Also Maurice Ravel disliked that label, yet both composers are considered forefathers or this style in music. "],"t":"p"},"\n",{"c":["\\'Impressionism' itself first appeared as aesthetics term in reference to colour- and light-focused paintings of Monet, Renoir, Degas. Later applied also to music in connection to the use of 'colour in music'- timbre. Elements often termed 'impressionistic' include static harmony, focusing on suggestion and atmosphere, use of modes and exotic scales, extra-musicality, avoidance of traditional musical form and focusing on timbre as a first-tier component of the musical performance. "],"t":"p"},"\n",{"c":["Personally, impressionism is one of my favourite periods in arts. There is some elusiveness in that style that makes the music sound intimate and mysterious. When performing an impressionistic piece sometimes it's not even about playing the right sounds that were written by a composer, but about creating a special atmosphere. And there is always a story to tell, behind the musical scores.

Quality of the sound in this recording is not the best, unfortunately, but I like this performance a lot because of it's intimacy, so I decided to upload it. I hope you will enjoy it too! :)"],"t":"p"},"\n",{"c":["Kat."],"t":"p"},"\n",{"t":"p"}],"t":"div"}}
