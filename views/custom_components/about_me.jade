      h2.h3 About Me
      span I am an openminded history and journalism graduate with the soul of an artist. I play flute and love music; I enjoy drawing, painting and I am interested in visual arts and design. Whilst living in Poland Iâ€™ve worked in a newspaper writing articles. I enjoyed writing since I remember and I hope that one day I will write a book. I am always looking towards improving myself and consider myself an ambitious and hardworking person, agile and quick to pick up new skills.
