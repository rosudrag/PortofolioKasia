# <center>The music poetry of Robert Schumann</center>

<br><br>

On 22'nd July 2017 I had the pleasure to take part in a beautiful concert 'The Music Poetry of Robert Schumann'. The event was held by Dean Row Unitarian Chapel in Wilmslow.

Specially for the ocasion, I prepared Three Romances op. 94 of Robert Schumann's. It consists of 3 short pieces in A-B-A form and was oryginally written by the composer for oboe, later transcribed for flute by famous flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal.

It was speculated that the piece was written during one of Schumanns manic episodes. Indeed, sometimes the music sounds really emotional and there is many interesting changes of tempos and dynamics. It is a pleasurable piece to play and to listen.

Below a video of the performance, hope you will enjoy it!
