# <center>Performing salsa with La Suerte Band<center>

<br><br>

Classical music is not the only music genre I play. Since around two years (although I don’t think anyone knows when exactly it begun, because we started as a group of friends just fancy playing music together in our spare time) I’m a member of salsa band named ‘La Suerte Band’. One might ask 'why salsa?’ but it’s another story that started with me doing salsa dancing classes in a dance school that also happened to be a community of amazing people (crazy about salsa). Since then I totally soaked in it and now playing with these guys is as natural and obvious thing for me as eating cereal in the morning.

Below some videos from our performances. Enjoy!
