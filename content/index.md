Musician for hire - niedziela.kat@gmail.com

# **About me**

Music is a powerful tool, it can change people's emotions, create a unique atmosphere and express more than the words can say. This is why I love music and why I love performing. I started learning flute when I was fourteen and I played ever since. I have worked with different music genres but, at the moment, I am mostly playing classical and salsa.

# **Flautist for hire**

I am currently available for hire for playing flute at all kinds of events in the vicinity of **Manchester, UK**.

A professional pianist is also available to accompany me.

For booking or more information contact me by email **<niedziela.kat@gmail.com>**
